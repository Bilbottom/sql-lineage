# SQL Lineage üîÄ

Personal SQL lineage generator.

Built on the following awesome libraries:

- [SQLGlot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) for SQL parsing
- [arguably](https://github.com/treykeown/arguably) for the CLI

## So... what is this? ü§î

> [!NOTE]
>
> This project is still in development and currently only parses the CTEs of an SQL query since that's all I need for now.

I write _a lot_ of SQL, and I often need to understand "lineage" in lots of different ways.

Things like [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [SQLMesh](https://sqlmesh.com/) are great for object lineage (tables, columns, etc.), but I often need to understand "lineage" like the CTE lineage in a query, among other things.

This project is just a personal tool to help me generate lineage diagrams (in [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax) for SQL queries to fit that requirement.

Upcoming improvements will (hopefully) include:

- Column lineage to Mermaid
- Semantic edges (e.g. distinguish between `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `UNION`, etc.)
- Lineage for multiple files in a single diagram

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

Grab a copy from PyPI like usual (note the `bills-` prefix):

```
pip install bills-sql-lineage
```

## Usage üìñ

Pass the path to a SQL file to the `lineage` command to generate the lineage as a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram:

```
lineage path/to/file.sql
```

This will write a Mermaid diagram to `path/to/file.mermaid`. You can control the target with the second argument:

```
lineage path/to/file.sql path/to/output.mermaid
```
